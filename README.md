Developed a Pygame-based game where eggs fall from different positions, requiring the players to catch them using a basket. 
Created and trained an AI agent using Reinforcement Learning techniques, specifically Deep-Q Learning with an epsilon-greedy policy, enabling it to play the game on its own and improve its egg catching strategy over time.
